The device catelog has good organization. However when an item is selected such as mobile phone, then apple iphone from the list, the search window should be prepopulated with a search term that should find the resulting nodes. Also, when a selection is made and a search term is populated a fundtion to add an alert based on that selecton should also be added. For instance, AI can determine a list of all bluetooth broadcast names for pacemakers on the market based on their known values. An extensive review of accessible open-source datasets and resources, employing the previously established list of broadcast name variations for pacemakers (including Azure XT, Azure S, Micra AV, Micra VR, BlueSync PM, MDT W1DR01, MDT W3DR01, AVEIR AR, AVEIR VR, Assurity MRI, Endurity MRI, Gallant ICD, Entrant CRT, Amvia Sky, Amvia HF, Evia DR, Rivacor DR, Acticor DX, ACCOLADE MRI, ESSENTIO MRI, INGENITY MRI, BSC ACCOLADE, BSC ESSENTIO, Percepta CRT, Solara CRT, Cobalt XT, Crome HF, HeartPOD, Chronicle ICM, Reveal LINQ, Biomonitor ICM, Assert-IQ, TriageHF, HeartLogic, BLE Pacemaker, Medical BLE Device, Cardiac Implant Broadcast, Heart Rate BLE, Thermometer BLE Profile, Medtronic Azure, BlueSync Enabled, Azure XT DR, Azure S SR, Micra AV2, Micra VR2, AVEIR LP, AVEIR i2i, LSP201A, LSP202V, LSL02 Module, BSC Latitude, ACCOLADE EL, ESSENTIO SR, INGENITY DR, BSC Pacer, Biotronik Amvia, Amvia Edge, Evia ProMRI, Rivacor HF, Acticor DX, BIOTRONIK PM, Cardiac BLE Sync, Implant BLE Broadcast, Heart Device Advert, Pacemaker BLE Name, Medical LP Beacon, and partial matches such as MDT, Azure, PM, AVEIR, DR, BSC, ACCOLADE, Evia, Liv, XT, S, Micra, AV, VR, BlueSync, W1DR01, W3DR01, AR, Assurity, Endurity, MRI, Gallant, ICD, Entrant, CRT, Amvia, Sky, HF, ProMRI, Rivacor, Acticor, DX, Latitude, EL, SR, INGENITY, Pacer, Edge, LP, i2i, LSP201A, LSP202V, LSL02, Enabled, Sync, Broadcast, Heart, Device, Advert, Name, Beacon, Cardiac, Implant, Medical, BLE), has been conducted. Comprehensive lists to be able to locate pacemakers or any category and make of device should also have search terms prebuilt to make serching for a node fast. Populate the caterories with more data like this to conduct searches
